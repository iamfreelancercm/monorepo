<h2 class="title">Two-factor authentication(2FA)</h2>
<p>Two factor authentication (2FA) refers to the authentication method that combines both passport and an object (credit card, SMS phone, token or biomarkers as fingerprint) to identify a user. To ensure the security of the committerâ€™s account, we need you to enable 2FA to sign in and contribute codes on GitHub. More details, please refer to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization/" target="_blank">2FA</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>If you do not enable 2FA, you will be removed from the project and unable to access our repositories and the fork from our private repository.</p>
<br />
<h2 class="title">Enable 2FA on GitHub</h2>
<p>For detailed operations, please refer to <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication" target="_blank">Enable Two Factor Authentication with TOTP</a>.</p>
<p>After enabling 2FA, you need to sign in GitHub with the way of username/password + mobile phone authentication code.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> If you cannot download the APP through the page link, you can search and download the Google Authenticator in APP Store.</p>
<br />
<h2 class="title">How to Submit Codes</h2>
<p>After enabling 2FA, you need to generate a private access Token to perform operations such as git submit and so on. At this time, you will use username + private access Token in replace of username + password to submit codes.</p>
